# Overview
### Over the past year or so Credit One has seen an increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans they have secured from various partners, and Credit One, as their credit scoring service, could risk losing business if the problem is not solved right away. The bottom line is they need a much better way to understand how much credit to allow someone to use or, at the very least, if someone should be approved or not.

## Project Goals
### Using the demographic data supplied by the client, determine:
#### 1. How much credit should customers be allowed
#### 2. Should a potential customer be approved for credit?
